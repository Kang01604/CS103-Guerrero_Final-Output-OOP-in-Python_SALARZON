# Q1: Instance Checks for Vehicle and Non-Vehicle
##############################################
# This block demonstrates several key OOP principles:
#   - Inheritance: 'SchoolBus' is derived from 'Vehicle'
#   - Encapsulation: 'Vehicle' uses "protected" attributes (names beginning with a single underscore)
#   - Polymorphism: The __str__ method is overridden in 'SchoolBus' to provide a custom string representation.
#   - Abstraction: 'Vehicle' provides a common interface (such as start_engine) for all vehicles.
#   - Instance Checking: Using isinstance() to distinguish between objects of different classes.
#
# There is also an unrelated class 'Fruit' that is used to demonstrate that classes not
# inheriting from 'Vehicle' do not have access to its methods.
#
# Note: The commented-out line shows an example of what happens if you try to call a
# method (start_engine) on an instance that doesnâ€™t have it, which would raise an AttributeError.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, model):
        # Initialize the protected attributes.
        # Using a single underscore (_name, _model) signals that these should not be accessed directly.
        self._name = name      
        self._model = model    

    def __str__(self):
        # Returns a standardized string representation of a vehicle.
        return f"Vehicle({self.name}, {self._model})"

    def start_engine(self):
        # Simulates the action of starting the vehicle's engine.
        return "Engine started."

class SchoolBus(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, name, model, capacity):
        # Call the parent constructor to initialize shared attributes: name and model.
        super().__init__(name, model)
        # Set the additional attribute unique to SchoolBus (its seating capacity).
        self.capacity = capacity

    def __str__(self):
        # Overrides the parent's __str__ method to include capacity information.
        return f"INFO: {self._name} School Bus, made in {self._model}, with a capacity of {self.capacity} passengers."

# Unrelated class that does not derive from Vehicle.
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        # Standard initialization for a Fruit; no relation to Vehicle.
        self.name = name
        self.color = color

    def __str__(self):
        # Provides a custom string representation for a Fruit.
        return f"INFO: {self.color} {self.name}"

# Q2: Build a class Employee with multiple constructors
##############################################
# This block illustrates several concepts:
#   - Encapsulation: Data (emp_id, name, department) is stored in instance attributes.
#   - Multiple Constructors: In addition to the primary __init__ constructor, two alternative
#     class methods (from_string and from_dict) provide ways to create an Employee.
#   - Static Methods: is_valid_department is defined as a static method to validate a department
#     without using any instance-specific information.
#   - Instance Methods: display_info prints the employee details.
#
# The multiple ways to construct an instance showcase the flexibility of class methods
# in providing alternate constructors for different data representations.

    def __init__(self, emp_id, name, department):

# the average and GPA while reusing the common display logic provided in display_stats().
